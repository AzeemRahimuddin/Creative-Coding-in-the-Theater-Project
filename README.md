# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

My animation shows two sports I like which are basketball and track. These are things I enjoy doing in my free time, and I wanted to use this project to share that with others. The animation has characters moving, background pictures, sounds, and words that describe how each sport feels to me. My user story says: As a student, I want to show my personal interests, in order to show others what I enjoy. This helped me stay focused while making the animation and reminded me that I was using code to show something about myself. I added sounds like a crowd cheering and a basketball dribbling as well as movements to make the animation more fun and show what I like.
